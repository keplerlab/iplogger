iplogger
===================

A tool which updates all the network interfaces on a machine. It should be scheduled to run at regular interval (crontab, scheduler, etc) & and as a start script. 

Standalone hardware installations using Desktops/Raspberry Pi/ ODROID, etc can benefit from this as the updated IP can be used for remotely commecting over the network.
